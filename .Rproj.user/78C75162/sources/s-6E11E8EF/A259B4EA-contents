## Data
The data is organised in the folder "data" as follows:

* **./data/**
This folder contains the cleaned/rotated Veizer and Prokoph (2015) data, the Zhang et al (2019) data, and the stratigraphic stage and period bins used in this study.

-------

## Analyses
Data analyses is set up to run as follows:

* **./R/options.R**
This script defines the options to use in the study (e.g. spatial resolution).

* **./R/run_analyses.R**
This script runs the analyses.

-------

## Results
The data is organised in the folder "results" as follows:

* **./results/SST/**
This folder contains the data related to model temperature gradients and global temperature estimates.

* **./results/spatial_stats/**
This folder contains the data related to summary spatial statistics.
